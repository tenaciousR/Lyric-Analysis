# Lyric Analysis


Here I am practicing my use of processing Natural Language on Python 3 using packages such as pandas, sklearn, nltk, csv, and matplotlib. 

Library including this artist's lyric set as wewll as 380,000+ other artist's lyrics can be found at this [Kaggle Lyrics Dataset][https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics]


Importing lyrics from a csv file, organizing the data into defined artist's songs through the years (selected Blink182 from lyric CSV file)
Removing common words and selecting a theme per top words used in songs of that year 
Setting value of 'important' words to either 0 or 1 and taking the sum of 'important' words per song per year
Plot 'important' words vs Year to see the artists 'feelings' throughout their career on the data base
